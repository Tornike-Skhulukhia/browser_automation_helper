    Module is in development/testing process.

    Most of functionality now is developed and mainly
    tested on google chrome V74, so some functions,
    like changing parameters(save location, disable javascript...)
    do not work for firefox, but we can still use other
    useful things.

    More support for other browsers may be added later.

    Module to make process of working with selenium much
    easier, faster and user-friendly, pleasant process.

    Capabilities that will probably be added:
        . login to a website - we supply selectors
        of username, password and submit button

        . dynamic visualization of selection -
            when we search for something in dom,
            we may use js to change border or text color,
            zoom text with cool effect,
            for example for 1 second, to see that that element
            is found(selected)

        . proxies - for now, free proxies are not
        good enough, so if better sources will be available,
        why not?

        . easier selectors than css/xpath, but using both + js
        (ex: *easier class selections with xpath)

        . automatic browser version identification and driver file
        download

        . captcha solver(at first simple ones)

        . easier multithreading/multiprocessing
        . . .
